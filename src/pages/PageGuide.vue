                                ZigZag never bothered with fixing wagons for a handful of copper. He
                                pieced together his workshop from scraps, and before long, his weird
                                gadgets caught the eye of the wrong crowd. But that was just the
                                start. ZigZag knew the real money was in the shadows — in the Goblin
                                Black Market. A filthy, dangerous place where tricks, deals, and
                                threats lurk at every corner. Before long, ZigZag was in, always
                                ahead of the law and the idiots trying to take him down. But there's
                                one thing that really makes his heart race — the thrill. That
                                constant hunger for the next big gamble. Whether it's selling cursed
                                trinkets or flipping
                                <i>Gambler's Lootboxes</i>, it doesn't matter. ZigZag's always
                                chasing the rush, always on the hunt for the next big score. For
                                him, the Black Market isn't just a place to trade — it's the
                                ultimate game, and he's in it to win.

                            the Goblin Black Market. Old as the hills and hidden from the light.
                            Only those who've proven themselves — whether through a clever deal or
                            surviving a tough scrape — can be invited to step into the Black Market.
                            Inside? It's chaos — cursed trinkets, ticking bombs, and all sorts of
                            weird stuff that might just blow your fingers off. No questions asked,
                            no refunds. The market's a maze of shady vendors always ready to make a
                            deal, but don't get too comfy — there's a lot of sneaky hands in the
                            air, looking to lift whatever isn't nailed down. Want trouble? Want
                            danger? Or maybe something... <i>strange</i>? This is the place for you.
                            But remember, things here aren't always what they seem. Don't wander off
                            into the shadows alone — who knows what could be lurking in the dark
                            corners. And don't be fooled, pal — everything here's gonna cost you
                            more than you think. Sometimes, more than your <i>soul</i>.

                                    the Black Market, there's just one thing you need — An
                                    <strong>invitation </strong>, and we can sell you one. Why waste
                                    time and energy getting the access when all you need is right
                                    here with me? To get in, you'll need to find the old sewers near
                                    the Rat's Tail Tavern. It's a bit of a maze down there, traps
                                    and all, plus you've got to deal with "Biggie" at the door. You
                                    wanna know how I get these invitations? Well, you better don't.
                                    Anyways, once you're in, it's all yours to discover — but be
                                    careful! After that, who knows what you'll find? By the way,
                                    Biggie is the giant shredder, in case you're wondering.
